		<h1>Welcome!</h1>
		<p>
			I am Morgan. I am an independent programmer. I have worked on a variety of front-end, back-end, and game development projects. Contact me at <a class="Card" target="_top" href="mailto:cymaera@heledron.com">cymaera@heledron.com</a>.

		<h2>ERP System</h2>
		<div style="display: flex; gap: 1rem;">
			<img src="./images/erp-desktop.png" alt="ERP Desktop" class="shadow-md" style="max-height: 400px; align-self: flex-start;">

		</div>

		<br>

		<p>
			This is a web-based ERP system that I developed for a food distribution company in Hong Kong. Initially a simple order entry system, it has since grown to include a variety of features such as inventory management, sales history, and reporting. It is supported on both desktop and mobile devices.
		</p>

		<p>
			Since deploying the tool, salespeople have been able to submit orders without having to call the office.
			They have immediate access to product inventory, sales history, and no longer have to cross reference product codes with a huge paper catalogue.
		</p>

		<p>
			Support staff no longer have to manually enter orders into their old system and generate routine reports. They can also create beautiful looking product brochures in seconds for sending to clients. Management estimates that these features save support staff 3-4 hours of work per day.
		</p>

		<p>
			Management has access to performance metrics and can make more informed decisions. They can generate aggregated reports in seconds, which would previously take hours to compile.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			This system has to manage a large amount of data whilst being usable in low-bandwidth/offline environments. I designed it to be offline-first using Service Workers and client-side caching.
		</p>

		<p>
			The system has to present complex information and actions to non-technical users. I put a lot of care into designing an interface that is easy and intuitive to use.
		</p>
			
		<p>
			Additionally, it has to integrate with an existing off-the-self system which has accrued a lot of technical debt.
			I reverse-engineered huge database tables with many confusingly named columns that were likely machine-generated by an ORM.
		</p>
			
		<p>
			I continue to add new features to the system and have worked with the company on other projects.
		</p>

		<h2 class="break-before-page">Marketing / Landing Page</h2>
		<div style="display: flex; gap: 1rem;">
			<img src="./images/coconutsugar.png" alt="ERP Desktop" class="shadow-md" style="max-height: 400px; align-self: flex-start;">
		</div>

		<p>
			<a href="https://615coconutsugar.com">615coconutsugar.com</a> is a marketing website I developed for a food distribution company in Hong Kong. The original website was built by a web design agency using Wordpress and hosted through an expensive plan. I helped rebuild the website using SvelteKit, significantly improving responsiveness and load times. I also added multi-lingual support (5 languages), support for mobile devices, and cleaned up the design.
		</p>

		
		<h2 class="break-before-page">Outlook Add-in</h2>
		<div style="display: flex; gap: 1rem;">
			<img src="./images/outlook-addin.png" alt="ERP Desktop" class="shadow-md" style="max-height: 400px; align-self: flex-start;">
		</div>

		<br>

		<p>
			This is an Outlook add-in I developed for a compliance company in Hong Kong. It includes a template system with rich-text, image, and automatic timezone conversion features.
		</p>

		<p>
			I was contracted to develop this add-in as a replacement for a legacy system that was built with VBA, which is being deprecated by Microsoft.
		</p>

		<p>
			For this project, I had to find clever workarounds as the new Outlook add-in API is much more limited than the old VBA API. Additionally, I had to design an interface that was easy to use for non-technical users.
		</p>
			
		<p>
			I continue to maintain and add new features to the system.
		</p>

		<h2 class="break-before-page">Heledron.com</h2>

		<p>
			<a href="https://heledron.com/" target="_blank">Heledron.com</a> is my personal website. It hosts a variety of art projects and tools to solve niche problems I encounter.
		</p>

		<p>
			A few notable examples include:
		</p>

		<h3>Reuleaux Polygon Generator</h3>

		<img class="shadow-md" src="/tools/reuleaux-polygon-generator/thumbnail.webp" style="max-width: 400px; width: 100%;" alt="Reuleaux Polygon Generator">
		<p>
			A tool for generating Reuleaux polygons. This tool was featured in a successful <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/mathmeetsmachine/make-100-revolution-evolution-3d-reuleaux-polygons-set" target="_blank">Kickstarter campaign</a>. This was the first of its kind to be made publicly available on the web (that I could find), and is currently still the only one that supports an "extension" parameter.
		</p>

		<h3>Sorting Algorithm Visualizer</h3>

		<img class="shadow-md" src="/misc/sorting-algorithm-visualizer/thumbnail.webp" style="max-width: 400px; width: 100%;" alt="Sorting Algorithm Visualizer" />
		<p>
			A tool for visualizing 11+ sorting algorithms. Although other tools for this already exist, I wanted to build one that would work on the web and visualize auxiliary memory.
		</p>
		
		<h3 class="break-before-page">Ascii 3D</h3>
		<img class="shadow-md" src="/misc/ascii3d/demos/water/thumbnail.webp" style="max-width: 400px; width: 100%;" alt="Ascii 3D" />
		<p>
			A 3D rendering pipeline that outputs ASCII characters instead of pixels. This was featured on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ARQh52GHNtk&t=1710s" target="_blank">BxJS Weekly</a>, a popular JavaScript podcast. This project taught me linear algebra and how 3D rendering pipelines work.
		</p>

		<h3>EMCL Compiler</h3>

		<p>
			A compiler which converts my own programming language (EMCL), into Minecraft function files, a verbose, low-level language with some similarities to assembly. It has accrued a small user base and has been featured on <a href="https://github.com/RanolP/awesome-mcje-vanilla-tech" target="_blank">some lists</a>.
			
			The compiler contains a lexical-analyser, syntax-analyser, semantic-analyser, optimizer, and code-generator, all built from scratch without any external libraries or generators.
			
			In developing this tool, I also learnt to create VSCode language extensions for simple syntax highlighting and code snippets.
		</p>

		<p>
			Here are some projects I built using this tool:

		<h3>Minecraft Modding</h3>
		<p>
			I have also developed a number of server plugins for Minecraft using Java and Kotlin. These include:
		</p>
		<div style="display: grid; gap: 1rem; grid-template-columns: repeat(2, 1fr);">

			I have also worked with the design studio <a href="https://varunabuilds.com/" target="_blank">Varuna</a>. I was the programer for
			<a href="https://headlinermagazine.net/alfie-templeman-celebrates-new-album-launch-with-virtual-minecraft-festival.html" target="_blank">The Alfie Templeman Minecraft Festival</a>, and <a href="https://varunabuilds.com/nijisanji-prism-cup" target="_blank">Nijisanji Prism Cup 2023</a>.

		<h2 class="break-before-page">Suspended projects</h2>
		<h3>UI Framework</h2>
		<p>
			A while ago, I attempted to develop a front-end UI framework. I have since abandoned this project, but I gained intimate knowledge of all the different rendering paradigms used by modern UI frameworks. Since then, I contributed resize observer bindings to the Svelte project, as I was frustrated by the legacy iframe-workaround.
		</p>

		<h3>Game Engine</h2>
		<div style="display: flex; gap: 1rem; flex-wrap: wrap; position: relative; align-items: start;">
			<img class="shadow-md" style="display: block; max-height: 300px;" src="./images/2d-shooter.png" alt="Game Engine">
			<img class="shadow-md nearest-neighbor" style="display: block; max-height: 300px;" src="./images/deep.png" alt="Game Engine">
		</div>
		<br>

		<p>
			A while ago, I developed a 2D game engine in JavaScript and made a few simple games with it. I have since abandoned this project, as my code quality has improved significantly and it would be easier to start from scratch. Since then, I have experimented with similar projects by building a number of 3D rendering pipelines, and played around with OpenGL and WebGL.
		</p>
	
		<h3 class="break-before-page">ICECube (Code Editor)</h2>
		<img style="width: 100%; display: block;" src="./images/icecube.png" alt="ICECube IDE">
	
		<p>
			ICECube is a code editor I developed a while ago. It had a web version using the relatively new File System Access API, and an Electron.js version which I never made public.
			It included a code-editor with syntax highting, and a JSON editor that could edit complex nested JSON objects from a schema.
			It was abandoned due to lack of users, and I am no longer satisfied with the code quality or UX. I learnt a lot as it was my first time building a complex application with a large codebase. It was also my first time using TypeScript and Electron.
